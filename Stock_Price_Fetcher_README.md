# Stock Price Fetcher

This is a simple Python program that fetches and displays the current stock price of a company from Google Finance. The program uses the `requests` library to fetch the stock price data, and `tkinter` for the graphical user interface (GUI). The stock symbol for companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India can be entered, and the current stock price will be displayed.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
- Displays stock name and price.
- Handles errors gracefully with error messages.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

2. Install the required dependencies:

3. Run the script:

   ```
4. Enter the stock symbol (e.g., `RELIANCE`) and click **Fetch Stock Price**.
5. The stock price will be displayed in the text box.
